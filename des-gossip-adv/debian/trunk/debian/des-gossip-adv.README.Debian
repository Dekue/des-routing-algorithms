des-gossip-adv for Debian
--------------------------------

des-gossip-adv provides an extension dissector for its extension that
can be used with Wireshark or tshark.

Call the particular program with the following parameter:
 PROGRAM -X lua_script:/usr/share/des-gossip-adv/des-gossip-adv.lua

Please note that the libdessert-dissectors Debian package is required!
It is not a dependency of this package to prevent that the user has to install
wireshark-common just to use des-gossip-adv.
