20110301 - version 2.0
    - Added feature to print routing table periodically to the log file
    - Added adaptive evaporation to force faster reduction of alternative routes
    - Fixed bug in the PASSIVE acknowledgement mode
    - Added LINEAR pheromone trail mode (linear increase and evaporation)
    - Fixed null pointer bug in ara_rt_modify_credit

201007123 - version 1.9
    - Added route pruning
    - Added CLI callback to configure pruning
    - Some code cleanup and documentation
    - Added several CLI callbacks to flush data structures
    - Added passive acknowledgements and corresponding CLI callbacks
    - Added network layer acknowledgements and corresponding CLI callbacks
    - Prepared to include link layer acknowledgements
    - The packet trap delay has been made more fine granular: seconds -> milli-seconds
    - Prefixed several CLI commands with "ara_"
    - New routing table intries will immediately untrap all corresponding packets
    - Added mode to increase the pheromone value only in forward direction
    - Cleaned up route fail handling
    - Added credit for missed ACKs in PASSIVE acknowledgement mode; also added corrsponding CLI commands
    - packets returned to the source with route fail flag without alternative route will now generate a FANT and trap the packet
    - Added TODO file
    - Removed sequence number from routing table entries as it was not used and make no sense here (see loop protection table)
    - Restructured routing table in two parts: 1) element in hashmap with a 2) list of next hops

201007122 - version 1.8
    - Fixed bug in route selection
    - Added random route selection

201007122 - version 1.7
    - Fixed bug in loop detection

201007122 - version 1.6
    - Multi-path routing should no work
    - Added CLI command to flush routing table
    - Added node disjoint mode
    - Added CLI command to enable/disable node disjoint mode

201007121 - version 1.5
    - Improved multi-path routing

20100719 - version 1.4
    - Some shared meshif and sysif callbacks have been split
    - Some code cleanup

20100716 - version 1.3
    - Do not drop duplicated packets for yourself

20100715 - version 1.2
    - The CLI is gives much more feedback when configuring parameters
    - Raised the log level of several messages from info to notice
    - Added CLI callbacks to show current forward and pheromone trail mode
    - Moved ara_forw_mode from ara_cli.c to ara_rt.c

20100713 - version 1.1
    - ARA and ARAC are now merged; the new protocol string is ARAX; added CLI callback to select pheromone trail mode
    - It is now ensured, that an ANT is always flooded backwards first, e.g., when an implicit FANT (for example ARP request) arrives and an unicast is send backwards.
    - Added missing callback to hande route lookup failures in sys callback pipeline
    - Moved BANT sending code into dedicated function.
    - Added several CLI callbacks to configure the cubic pheromone trail creation, aging, and maintenance
    - Added several CLI callbacks to show the current configuration
    - Corrected some spelling mistakes
